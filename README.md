# XMRig-Crypto-Miner
Learning how to mine cryptocurrency coins using a high performance, open-sourced, unified CPU miner

## download [XMRig](https://xmrig.com/)
XMrig is an opensourced unified CPU/GPU miner that is available for Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD. Once you download the zip file, you should be able to open it and view similar files to these:

## Go to [unMineable.com](https://unmineable.com/coins)
View the different types of coins you can mine, and choose one that you can connect with your Crypto Wallet. I used [metamask: create an account here](https://metamask.io/download.html). Once you've chosen a coin, read the instructions on the page, and edit the config.json file as necessary.

## Begin mining
Once you've finished editing the config.json file, try running the executable file from the folder. It should open the terminal and begin running. You'll see new job notifications running which means it's begun mining, and you'll see accepted notifications for the jobs you complete. If you want to check the balance of your wallet for the particular coin you're mining, you can check your stats by inputing your wallet address into [unMineable's sidebar](https://unmineable.com/coins)

## Is it worth it?
The idea of mining cryptocurrency passively with your laptop sounds interesting, but it wasn't worth it. It took a considerable amount of energy to mine (13 watts, whereas Idle power consumption is rated at 6.8 watts), and the rate at which you accumulate crypto is surprisingly slow. After running the algorithm for approximately 24 hours, I only mined a total of 0.02564462 MANA (Decentraland Coin), which is priced at $3.74. This means that in 24 hours I only mined roughly 1/10th of a penny in a day.

With this in mind, I don't think mining cryptocurrency on your laptop (Apple Macbook M1 chip), is worth the energy consumption. However, seeing how easy it is to mine cryptocurrency is a great learning opportunity and introduction to the subject.
