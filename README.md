## Go to [unMineable.com](https://unmineable.com/coins)
View the different types of coins you can mine, and choose one that you can connect with your Crypto Wallet. I used [metamask: create an account here](https://metamask.io/download.html). Once you've chosen a coin, read the instructions on the page, and edit the config.json file as necessary.

## Begin mining
Once you've finished editing the config.json file, try running the executable file from the folder. It should open the terminal and begin running.

You'll see new job notifications running which means it's begun mining, and you'll see accepted notifications for the jobs you complete. If you want to check the balance of your wallet for the particular coin you're mining, you can check your stats by inputing your wallet address into [unMineable's sidebar](https://unmineable.com/coins)
